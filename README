= About =

Wrapper DLLs to trace OpenGL, D3D8, and D3D9 APIs calls.


= Status =

* Direct3D 8 and 9 are broken at the moment.
* It has not been tested with many applications. Bugs may cause the application to crash. 


= Building from source =

Common requirements:
* Python (requires version 2.6)
* CMake (tested with version 2.8)

== Linux ==

Build as:

 cmake -H. -Bbuild
 make -C build

== Windows ==

Requirements:
* Microsoft Visual Studio (tested with 2008 version) or MinGW (tested with gcc version 4.4)
* Microsoft DirectX SDK (tested with August 2007 release)

To build with Visual Studio invoke CMake as:

 cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" -H%CD% -B%CD%\build
 cmake --build %CD%\build --config MinSizeRel
 
It's also possible to build on Linux with MinGW cross compilers.  See
http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CmakeMingw for detailed instructions.


= Usage =

== Linux ==

* Run the application you want to trace as

 LD_PRELOAD=path/to/glxtrace.so path/to/application

* View the trace with

 path/to/dump application.trace

* Replay the trace with

 path/to/glretrace application.trace


== Windows ==

* Copy opengl32.dll, d3d8.dll, or d3d9.dll to the directory with the application you want to trace.
* Run the application.
* View the trace with

 path/to/dump application.trace

* Replay the trace with

 path/to/glretrace application.trace
