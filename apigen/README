This directory contains several helper scripts that facilitate the generation
of the API descriptions from specs and/or header files.

The specs/headers are not expressive enough, which is why we can't just code
generate everything from them.

For GL the typical procedure is to run

  make -B

and then manually crossport new functions / enums to the files in the top dir
via a side-by-side diff tool, such as gvimdiff.
